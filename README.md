#Build and Configure Rosetta Objects

The Rosetta framework uses a unique syntax that will be unfamiliar at first glance. When initially creating image objects, there is a lot of unavoidable duplication of code. This becomes tedious when the abosolute positioning of images requires constant manual meauring in Photoshop or in the browser, or sometimes, just guesswork.

This small app will allow you to build the JavaScript objects required by the rosetta framework to render banner adverts. 

##Prereqs
Currently this program requires NodeJS to be installed on the user's machine, and basic use of CLI.
