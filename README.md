#Build and Configure Rosetta Objects

The Rosetta framework uses a unique syntax that will be unfamiliar at first glance. When initially creating image objects, there is a lot of unavoidable duplication of code. This becomes tedious when the abosolute positioning of images requires constant manual meauring in Photoshop or in the browser, or sometimes, just guesswork.

This small app will allow you to build the JavaScript objects required by the rosetta framework to render banner adverts. 

##Prereqs
Currently this program requires NodeJS to be installed on the user's machine, and basic of CLI knowledge. In other words, it isn't built into App.js or anything and I don't have a container that will allow for the upload of files, which is a requirement presently.

##Use
* Pull down the master branch
* Open the directory in Terminal
* If this is the first time you're using the application, run `npm install && bower install && gulp launch`
* If you've run the install commands before however, you can just run the `gulp launch` to open the application in the browser
